#General idea for inner working of audio analysis

#Divide video up into equal small segments.

#transcribe each segment of small video.

#Use third party llm like ollama 2.0 to piece together which video clips/segments to keep
# and which ones to edit out.

#Piece together the final video. THis is likely for vlogging or other similar 
#type sof videos
